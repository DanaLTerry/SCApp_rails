      <h3>STUDENT PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT<h3>
<p>All persons/students participating in any travel program of Synaptic Communities, hereafter referred to as 
"SC", must accept the following statements:1. I do voluntarily and without reservation on behalf of myself, 
my heirs and my estate, release and discharge absolutely and forever, SC, and any of its agents or program 
partners, and waive all claims, demands, of whatever nature for any injury, loss, damage, accident, delay, 
actions or cause of action, known or unknown, which I now have or may acquire in the future, irregularity or 
expense arising out of or directly or indirectly relating to my participation in a SC program, and arising 
from the use of any vehicle or services, strikes, war, acts of terrorism, weather, sickness, quarantine, 
government, airline, buses, transporting company, firm, individual, or agency. I understand the terms of 
this Release and the consequences of it and acknowledge that I have not executed it under duress.</p>

<h3>HIS IS A RELEASE.<h3>
<ol>
<p>1. I grant SC, or one of its agents, full authority to take whatever action they feel is warranted 
regarding my health and safety and that they may arrange medical treatment for me, at my expense and that 
if deemed necessary by the SC personnel and/or local medical authorities, I will be sent back to the 
United States at my own expense for further medical treatment.</p>
2. I will comply with all the required visas and international travel documents requested by authorities in 
destination and transit countries in which I travel, as well as their expiration dates for both passports and 
Visas. All passports must not expire any sooner than six months after the trip date. I understand that failing 
to comply will result in trip cancellation at my own expense. I understand that I must bring a crisp $10 for 
entry into Nicaragua.</p>
<p>3. If I cancel my trip for any reason or fail to comply with any international travel regulations, 
THERE WILL BE NO REFUNDS.</p>
<p>4. I understand this is a supervised program and agree to uphold individual and group standards set 
forth by SC personnel. These standards include: -No alcohol abuse or any illicit drugs. -No females in male 
sleeping area and vice versa. -A midnight curfew applies for the entire trip. SC will no longer be responsible
 of students after the end of the seventh day of the program. This is to give students freedom to make their 
 own travel arrangements after the end of the program. -Students with special diet requirements must bring 
 their necessary dietary supplements. -If I have any reason to leave the trip group, I must first obtain the 
 permission of a responsible SC staff member. This is for safety reasons.</p>
<p>5. If my conduct is deemed incompatible with the interests and the standards of the group and if my 
enrollment is TERMINATED, no refunds can be expected and returning to the United States is at my own expense. 
A verbal warning will be provided prior to expulsion from the program. A written report will be provided 
later.</p>
<p>6. I understand this is NOT a tourist-type program, but is a learning program as well as an international 
humanitarian team effort serving disadvantaged people in sometimes remote and difficult circumstances which, 
on occasion, may include travel over long distances, on land, air and water, on safe transportation.</p>
<p>7. I grant SC permission to reproduce photographs or movies, of me taken during the period of time that 
I am participating in this program, including written statements I may make concerning this program.</p>
<p>8. The calendar deadline for all SC trip applications and all SC trip payments is eight (8) weeks before 
the beginning trip date for which you have applied. Our staff needs this to finalize reservations and 
services for you. When you submit an application, you will be placed on the ''applied for'' list for that trip. 
When you submit your payment you will be placed on the ''final trip list''.</p>
<p>9. I declare that I am not addicted or habituated to the use of non-/or prescription mood altering 
drugs/chemicals, including alcohol, and will not seek these drugs while on a SC trip.</p>
<p>10. A midnight curfew applies for the entire trip for safety reasons. This means that all trip participants 
and SC staff must be inside our hotel before midnight and remain there the rest of the night.</p>
<p>11. No alcohol abuse or any illicit drug use will be allowed. If this is violated, the participant(s) 
will be specifically warned, verbally and in writing, and a second violation can result in a dismissal of 
that participant from the remainder of the trip. There will be no refunds and any additional related 
expenses will be paid by that trip participant.</p>
<p>12. Travel and health insurance is the responsibility of each trip participant.</p>
<p>13. Any trip participant activities either before the in-country arrival day or after the end of the 
seventh day of the program are not the responsibility of SC. This includes any tours, visits or sightseeing 
that I may elect to do in the trip country or elsewhere. I do those things upon my own initiative and 
responsibility and at my own risk, whether before or after the SC trip.</p>
<ol>

<p>Please show this agreement to your parents or any other person(s) who may feel a shared responsibility for your well-being.</p>

<p>BE SURE TO MAKE YOUR OWN COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR YOUR RECORDS</p>
